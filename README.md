# AI-Bio-sample-Separating-Robot
This repository contains the entire source code used to control the precise movements of the AI Bio-sampling robot: everything from computer vision, colour detection, precise measurements of solution height , to G-code for the movement of the stepper motors. Here is a video of how the robot works : https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ps5888-2022-g04/project-overview/
